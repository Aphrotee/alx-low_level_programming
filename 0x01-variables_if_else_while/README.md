# Variables, Conditional statements and While loops
This is a project folder for learning conditional statements with Boolean operators.
While loops too.
So far, I find the whole concept of conditional statements and booolean operators very interesting because it comes as an application of my knowledge of logic gates.
Also, while loops are very similar, just that they're constructed differently.
